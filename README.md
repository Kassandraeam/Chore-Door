# Chore-Door
Project from Codecademy's Building Interactive JavaScript Websites Pro Course

Key Concepts:
- JavaScript and the DOM
- Conditionals
- Functions

Goals for This Project:

Build a Chore Door guessing game:
- Each round will hide the ChoreBot behind a random door.
- Clicking on a door will change its image revealing a safe space or the ChoreBot.
- If the ChoreBot is behind the last door to be opened, you win!

JavaScript Functions that we will create:
- Randomize the location of the ChoreBot.
- Change the image of the doors with onclick listeners.
- Determine which user actions are winning conditions and which are losing conditions.
- Reset game variables to their original state with the start of each new round.
